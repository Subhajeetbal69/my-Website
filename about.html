  <h1>About iEducation</h1>
  <p>Transforming rural education through technology, innovation, and equal access to learning opportunities.</p>
</div>

<div class="about-container">

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>

  <p>
    iEducation is a social initiative dedicated to transforming rural education through technology and inclusive learning opportunities.
    We believe every child deserves quality education, regardless of where they live or what background they come from.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many rural children face challenges such as lack of digital access, shortage of trained teachers, and limited awareness of career paths.
    We work to bridge this gap and help students become confident, curious, and future-ready learners.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Do</h2>

  <p>
    We design programs that build strong academic foundations while also focusing on digital literacy, creativity, and life skills.
    Our work includes digital learning labs, STEM workshops, mentorship programs, teacher training, and community education initiatives.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>digital learning and smart-class support</li>
    <li>coding, STEM and innovation workshops</li>
    <li>career guidance and scholarship awareness</li>
    <li>teacher training and resource support</li>
    <li>community engagement for rural education</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>

  <p>
    Our vision is a world where every child — rural or urban — has equal access to technology, education, and opportunities to succeed.
    We believe education builds confidence, courage, and character along with knowledge.
  </p>

  <div class="mission-box">
    <b>Our Mission</b><br>
    To empower children with the knowledge, skills and confidence they need to build a better future for themselves and their communities.
  </div>

  <h2>Our Core Values</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Equity:</b> every child matters</li>
    <li><b>Innovation:</b> creative solutions for real problems</li>
    <li><b>Integrity:</b> honesty and transparency</li>
    <li><b>Community First:</b> we work with people, not just for them</li>
    <li><b>Sustainability:</b> long-term impact, not temporary charity</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our Impact</h2>

  <p>
    Students engaged with iEducation develop digital skills, improved academic performance, communication ability,
    and awareness of future career paths. Teachers receive support and communities begin to value education more deeply.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Goals</h2>

  <p>
    We aim to expand to more villages, create digital learning centers, support girl education initiatives,
    and connect more students with scholarships, mentors, and higher education opportunities.
